Laracon Online 2017 Notes
-------------------------

By request, here are the notes I took on some of the presentations given at Laracon
Online 2017.

Notes on Matt Stauffer's talk were added by Oleg Baranovsky (olegvb). Thanks Oleg!

Feel free to do what you like with these, but if anything interesting comes of whatever
you do with them, let me know.  :)
